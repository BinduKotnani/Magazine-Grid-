            <h4>What is RIP?</h4>
            <p>RIP stands for RestIn Peace. Some professional or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, for example the Journal of Accountancy.

In its original sense, the word "magazine" referred to a storage space or device. In the case of written publication,it refers to a collection of written articles.</p>
